# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to analyze and predict stock market trends. The project leverages data analytics and machine learning techniques to provide insights and future projections for stock prices.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Import stock market data from online sources such as Yahoo Finance.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize data, and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Visualization**: Create detailed visualizations to understand historical stock trends.
- **Prediction**: Use of Monte Carlo Simulations to predict Value at Risk.

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `keras` or `tensorflow`
- `yfinance` (for fetching stock data)

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow yfinance
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/stock-market-analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stock Market Analysis and Prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the step-by-step code execution:
   - Load stock data.
   - Perform exploratory analysis.
   - Train prediction models.
   - Evaluate the predictions.

## Key Outputs
- Insights from exploratory data analysis, including stock performance trends and volatility.
- Predicted stock prices with visualization comparing actual vs. predicted values.

## Potential Applications
- **Retail Investors**: Assist in making data-driven investment decisions.
